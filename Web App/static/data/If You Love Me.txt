                                                                                                    Its been a while since I’ve seen you
Hanging around with somebody new
Trying to hit it like you used to
But no ones trying to play your game

Sometimes I wonder
If you think about me
And if you miss saying my name
Sometimes I wish that
You would always want me
But I guess nothing ever stays the same

If you loved me
Why’d you leave me?
Left me with nothing, nothing
If you loved me
Why’d you leave me?
Just give me something, something

Don’t give up now
Yeah I’m falling down
Trying to hold onto these memories
Don’t give up now
Yeah I’m falling down
Trying to convince myself
You’re into me

Yea I know you're the only one
That touch my soul
But sometimes love is not enough
That's why I had to go
I cannot deny that I think of you
It still breaks my heart don't know
What to do
Sometimes I just wanna come back
But my heart keeps
Telling me not to do that
Should I stay should I go
My baby I don't know
I swear it breaks my heart
But girl I just don't let it show
You see me and you thinking that
I already moved on
But sometimes I wanna hear
Your voice over the phone

It’s been a year since I’ve seen you
And now you have got somebody new
Holding her hand like we used to
Babe, she’s fallen for your game

If you loved me
Why’d you leave me?
Left me with nothing, nothing
If you loved me
Why’d you leave me?
Just give me something, something
Don’t give up now
Yeah I’m falling down
Trying to hold onto these memories
Don’t give up now
Yeah I’m falling down
Trying to convince
Myself you’re into me
