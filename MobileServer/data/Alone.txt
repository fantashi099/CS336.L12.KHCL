Late night, it's cold outside
She don't need him anymore she only got me on her mind
Fantasize, man I'm blind
people told me that she a player she don't need to be
By my side
By my side
Yeah yeah she ain't catching shit for me
Am I just a toy? 
Yeah yeah she don't need a ring from me
I was just another boy 
Yeah she's too high for me
Yeah we're not meant to be

But baby won't you give me one more chance
Can't you see I won't leave where I stand? 
Could you be a little less complex
Fuck him baby I can be your next

Sau 1 tình yêu em luôn cảnh giác
Sợ yêu như tội phạm sợ cảnh sát
Em không cho ai thêm những cơ hội
Không ai có quyền làm em trơ trọi
Thêm một lần nữa
Em không cần nữa
Yêu là căn bệnh em đang cần chữa
Mất đi phần giữa sau những hơn thua
Không muốn lần nào sẽ phải dây dưa
She's lazy to love
She already said nope
No way! She said no hope
Oh baby i cant stop
Baby i cant stop
oh baby i cant stop
She doesnt need my joke
She doesnt need my job
Em bây giờ đây đâu còn tin thêm một ai
Em đâu còn yêu, đâu còn feel thêm một ai
Em đâu cần nghe những lời yêu thường ngoài tai
"Wake up boy, im not your paradise"
It's easy for you
But it's hard for me
It's easy for you
But it's hard for me
Ou
Baby it's not my day
baby im out of your way
baby i have no way
i cant feel my face
Baby it's not my day
baby im out of your way
baby i have no way
